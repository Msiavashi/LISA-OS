---- File System ----
If you want to include a file in your file system then run the make_initrd program in terminal and give it command-line arguemnts as follows:
./make_initrd [file address (in your computer)] [file name in Rack OS file system]
By continuing this pattern you can give as many files as you wish. [Read make_initrd.c source file for more information]
